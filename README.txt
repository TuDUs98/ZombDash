you can edit levels with file map.txt:
    levels must have size = 70, 65
    0 - empty
    1 - wall
cheat-codes:
    KOP - a lot of points(they will 'spawn' very quickly)
    LMS - cheat-code for immortality
    ZXC - instant death

    # if you want to use cheat-code, you should clamp the buttons in the same time
!!!YOUR RECORD WILL BE SAVE ONLY IF YOU DEAD!!!
